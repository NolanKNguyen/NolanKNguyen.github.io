  <p>Game Summary: Echoes of the Mind</p>

<p>Echoes of the Mind is a psychological horror and interactive fiction game built in Twine. Set inside a decaying and secretive insane asylum, the player wakes up with no memory, no name, and no sense of who to trust. As they explore, they uncover unsettling clues about experiments, lost patients, and a mysterious girl known only as Subject 019. The asylum is a maze of manipulation, and every choice affects whether the player regains their identity, loses their sanity, or becomes another cog in the machine.

The central themes of the game revolve around mental autonomy, memory, control, and rebellion. We wanted to explore the blurry line between survival and submission—what it means to stay sane in a place that treats you like a test subject. The game comments on systems of power that exploit people who are seen as vulnerable or "broken," and asks whether escape is even possible—or if you have to become part of the system to destroy it.

My intended audience is older teens and adults who enjoy psychological thrillers, moral ambiguity, and nonlinear storytelling. Fans of games like Silent Hill, A Dark Room, and A Witch's Word will find familiar tones here. The branching paths, stats tracking, and variable-based dialogue give the game high replay value while maintaining an emotionally grounded narrative.

Players begin the game with low Trust and Sanity values, which fluctuate depending on how they interact with the environment and characters. These two core variables shape the tone of conversations and unlock or block different endings. For example, players who are too aggressive or too withdrawn may end up punished—becoming test subjects or losing themselves entirely. On the other hand, those who stay alert and adaptable might find rare chances for survival—or something more.

The narrative structure includes several major branches:

The Mirror Path, which grants sanity and hints at the player’s past.

The Vent Escape, where players try to physically escape the asylum through hidden tunnels.

The Staff Lounge, which opens up the possibility of a full-scale asylum breakout.

The Doctor Routes, where interactions with a manipulative doctor lead to either experimentation, betrayal, or a fragile alliance.

The Breath Path, a slow-burn survival route where the player pretends to assimilate and goes undercover as a staff member.

The Forgotten Name and Silent Paths, which lead to chilling bad endings, including losing all identity or becoming part of the staff permanently.

There are also layered secrets like the girl known as Subject 019. If players find the right branches—such as search logs like “search019” or explore deep lab files—they’ll uncover hints that the girl knew them, remembered them, and might still be alive. This adds an emotional backbone to the game and recontextualizes previous choices, especially in endings where the player has the chance to "find her" amid chaos.

I’ve designed multiple endings: solo escape escape with betrayal joining the staff being tested on until death undercover infiltration “reunion with the girl” "True Loyalty" ending where you and Patient 42 survive together—only if your trust is high enough. Each ending reflects the path you took and how much of yourself you held onto.

To me, Echoes of the Mind is more than a survival story. It’s a study of choice under pressure, identity under threat, and hope inside an institution built to erase it. With each playthrough, the player uncovers more of the truth—and must decide what they’re willing to sacrifice to reclaim their mind.</p>
